    <p>Refunds and cancellations are not applicable because our platform operates on a prepaid wallet and reward model, where users voluntarily add funds to their wallet to post bounties, and those funds are allocated to hunters upon task completion. Once funds are added, they are immediately committed to the bounty ecosystem, making refunds or cancellations technically and operationally infeasible.</p>
